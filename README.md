# Kizuna AI Attendance Log

An interactive log of all videos on [A.I.Channel](https://www.youtube.com/aichannel), [A.I.Games](https://www.youtube.com/aigamesdayo), and [A.I.Channel China](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCArUdy5xj0i0cTuhPHRVMpw) from the day Love-chan and AI-pii were installed to the day they resigned from the identity of Kizuna AI.

Its main purpose is to show which videos AI-chan, Black AI, Love-chan, AI-pii, and AI-bro participated in.

This was made mostly as a reaction to the common misinformed claim that the original voice model was replaced.
Hopefully this project can make clear that this never was the case.
