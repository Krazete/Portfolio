# Kizuna AI Attendance Log

An interactive log of all videos on [A.I.Channel](https://www.youtube.com/aichannel), [A.I.Games](https://www.youtube.com/aigamesdayo), and [A.I.Channel China](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCArUdy5xj0i0cTuhPHRVMpw) from the day Love-chan and AI-pii were installed to the day they resigned from the identity of Kizuna AI.

There are two versions of the attendance log:

* [Live Version](https://krazete.github.io/ailog/live)
  * uses the YouTube Data API to retrieve up-to-date information for each video
  * sometimes messes up the chronological order due to loading videos in batches of 50

* [Static Version](https://krazete.github.io/ailog/static)
  * probably has nearly identical data because ratings and view counts don't change much months after a video is published
  * loads faster (it isn't held back by quota limits, so videos don't need to be lazy loaded)
  * doesn't have any weird order issues

Its main purpose is to show which videos AI-chan, Black AI, Love-chan, AI-pii, and AI-bro participated in.

I reviewed and marked all 488 videos myself.

While I did thoroughly check each video, I may have missed some entries.
I would've missed AI-chan and Love-chan in AI-pii's Christmas livestream if I hadn't checked the last few minutes knowing it was the last of 3 livestreams that day.
I also would've missed Love-chan's participation in AI-pii's 9-hour livestream if I hadn't checked the comments for timestamps.

If I did miss anything, please let me know.
