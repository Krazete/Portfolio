# Kizuna AI Attendance Log

An interactive log of all videos on [A.I.Channel](https://www.youtube.com/aichannel), [A.I.Games](https://www.youtube.com/aigamesdayo), and [A.I.Channel China](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCArUdy5xj0i0cTuhPHRVMpw) from the day Love-chan and AI-pii were installed to the day they resigned from the identity of Kizuna AI and formed [love-pii Channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYm8zALd2uHqyy6C1tb4_zA).

Its main purpose is to show which videos AI-chan, Black AI, Love-chan, AI-pii, and AI-bro participated in.

## Symbols

The website's symbols for each AI should be obvious, but here's a chart anyway:

|Symbol|Version of Kizuna AI|
|:-:|-|
|<img src="icon/ai.png" width="32px">|AI-chan / Oyabun / Original / OG|
|<img src="icon/black.png" width="32px">|Black AI|
|<img src="icon/love.png" width="32px">|Love-chan / AI-neesan / キュール / AI #2|
|<img src="icon/pii.png" width="32px">|AI-pii / AImouto / すきぴ / AI #3|
|<img src="icon/bro.png" width="32px">|AI-bro / AI-ge / Chinese AI / AI #4|

## Versions

There are two versions of the attendance log.

### [Live Version](https://krazete.github.io/ailog/live)

* uses the YouTube Data API to retrieve up-to-date information for each video
* sometimes messes up the chronological order due to loading videos in batches of 50

### [Static Version](https://krazete.github.io/ailog/static)

* probably has nearly identical data because ratings and view counts don't change much months after a video is published
* loads faster (it isn't held back by quota limits, so videos don't need to be lazy loaded)
* doesn't have any weird order issues

Both versions lazy load all thumbnails for efficiency and faster initialization.

## Motivation

This project was made mostly in response to the common misinformed claim that the original has been replaced or was being forced out by upd8.
This was never the case.

AI-chan said during AI Party 2019 that [she never planned on leaving](https://warosu.org/jp/thread/21612492#p21615639).
A month later, AI-pii [addressed the growing concerns in her livestream](https://youtu.be/IwIoDYymgVs?t=61) saying AI-chan wasn't leaving, and she'd bring her back if she did.

During Love-chan's and AI-pii's existence as Kizuna AIs, AI-chan:

* released the song [Sky High](https://youtu.be/yLrstz80MKs) ([whose lyrics can't contain a secret message from her since she didn't write it](https://youtu.be/vk3tY4hwr3M?t=546)),
* performed at [Summer Sonic](https://youtu.be/O57ueFS0M6o), [DIVE XR](https://twitter.com/aichan_nel/status/1175769837622030337), [J-WAVE](https://twitter.com/aichan_nel/status/1173189719578042369), [Bilibili Macro Link VR](https://twitter.com/aichan_nel/status/1152094751849504770), and [Momoiku](https://youtu.be/-sv3WxrunOw)
* cohosted the television program [てえてえTV](https://cu.ntv.co.jp/program/tetete2/) alongside fellow upd8 members the Omega Sisters

Meanwhile, her voice model Kasuga Nozomi took on some voice acting roles:

* Granbelm (as Mimi Rin)
* Infinite Dendrogram (as the interface AI)
* Shirobako Movie (as a virtual idol) *(I haven't seen it, I'm just taking Discord user Guest#3616's word for it.)*

In short, she hasn't been replaced.
She's been busy.

Hopefully this project helps to clarify the fact that AI-chan has never left.

## Additional Notes

### Logging

I reviewed and marked all 488 videos myself.
While I did thoroughly check each video, I may have missed some entries.

I would've missed AI-chan and Love-chan in AI-pii's Christmas livestream if I hadn't checked the last few minutes knowing it was the last of 3 livestreams that day.
I also would've missed Love-chan's participation in AI-pii's 9-hour livestream if I hadn't checked timestamps in the comment section.

If I did miss anything, please let me know.

### A.I.Channel China

I realize A.I.Channel China's videos were uploaded on Bilibili much earlier than their YouTube publish date.
This means AI-bro's content is not truly in chronological order.
More importantly, it means some later videos which should be included are not displayed here.

Due to the rarity of collaborations on A.I.Channel China, this error is a minor one.
Thus, I did not make any attempt to fix the issue.
