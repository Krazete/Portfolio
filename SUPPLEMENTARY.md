# The First Three Months

The attendance log doesn't show the full picture.

The [replacement conspiracy theory](https://www.bilibili.com/read/cv3226164) has no credence today, but it did seem plausible in the beginning.

## Absence

In the three or so months following AI Party 2019, AI-chan's uploads seemed to be from a backlog of videos recorded before the event. For example:

* Love-chan and AI-pii sometimes used the newer 3D model (apparent from the updated shoulders and bangs); AI-chan always used the old 3D model.
* A snapshot of her [face filter video in September](https://youtu.be/Qbu3GhkT7Cc) was posted [on Twitter back in June](https://twitter.com/aichan_nel/status/1140843072797851648).

So while she showed up in videos, AI-chan did indeed appear to be absent for a while.

## Explanations

### Voice Acting

Kizuna AI's voice model, Kasuga Nozomi, had a voice acting role in Granbelm shortly after AI Party 2019. (I don't know if voicing a minor character constitutes enough reason to be too busy for YouTube, but I'll count it as one reason.)

### Official Statements

AI-pii explained this absence by saying AI-chan was busy preparing for Summer Sonic in August and would be back on the channel after the event.

[Activ8's statement](https://twitter.com/8AndAHalfTails/status/1162335355040931841) added on, saying that Love-chan and AI-pii had taken over A.I.Channel and A.I.Games to better acquaint the fans while AI-chan focused on music. (This was a mere explanation of the ongoing situation, not a declaration of a permanent shift of activities.)

AI-chan returned the same day of Activ8's statement in [a livestream](https://youtu.be/x58aOzpWoGU) where she also explained her absence. (As many commenters point out, there are moments where it sounds like she's crying. *Was she forced by upd8 to cover up the real situation? Was she sad about fans' reactions to the new AIs? Was she dealing with a personal issue at the time? Was it even crying?* I don't know. I won't surmise anything from this.)

In the month after Summer Sonic, her uploads were still scarce (as stated in the previous section, some were from the June backlog).

## Return

From October 2019 on, she seemed to have actually returned to YouTube. Often appearing alongside Love-chan and AI-pii, nobody could reasonably argue that these new videos were months-old recordings.

This is where the replacement rumor should've ended.

But of course it didn't, which is partly why Love-chan and AI-pii felt the need to shed the identity of Kizuna AI and [leave her channel](https://youtu.be/AmLFSguxTRY).
The rumor will probably still persist, but it's much easier to debunk now.
