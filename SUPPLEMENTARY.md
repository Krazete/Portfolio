# The First Three Months

The attendance log doesn't show the full picture. The [replacement conspiracy theory](https://www.bilibili.com/read/cv3226164) might not have any credence today, but it did seem plausible in the beginning considering the context.

In April 2019, there was news that the Unlimited staff was mistreating members of the Game Club Project. Later in June, Unlimited began replacing the voice talents. They [justified these actions on July 17](https://gameclubproject.jp/20190717info/) by explaining that the Game Club Project members were never VTubers; they were actually CTubers, or Character YouTubers. Undermining the importance of the voice talents didn't sit well with fans, and the channel still suffers from an average like-dislike ratio of less than 50% to this day (July 2020).

Kizuna AI cloned herself during the same period of time, so naturally people saw some similarities and assumed the worst.

## Absence

In the three months following AI Party 2019, AI-chan's uploads seemed to come from a backlog of videos recorded before the event. For example:

* Love-chan and AI-pii sometimes used the newer 3D model (apparent from the updated shoulders and bangs); AI-chan always used the old 3D model.
* A snapshot of her [face filter video in September](https://youtu.be/Qbu3GhkT7Cc) was posted [on Twitter way back in June](https://twitter.com/aichan_nel/status/1140843072797851648).

So while she showed up in videos, AI-chan did indeed appear to be absent for a while.

## Explanations

### Voice Acting

Kizuna AI's voice model, Kasuga Nozomi, had a voice acting role in Granbelm shortly after AI Party 2019. (I don't know if voicing a minor character constitutes enough reason to be too busy for YouTube, but I'll count it.)

### Official Statements

AI-pii explained this absence by saying AI-chan was busy preparing for Summer Sonic in August and would be back on the channel after the event.

[Activ8's statement](https://twitter.com/8AndAHalfTails/status/1162335355040931841) added on, saying that Love-chan and AI-pii had taken over A.I.Channel and A.I.Games to better acquaint the fans while AI-chan focused on music. (This was a mere explanation of the ongoing situation, not a declaration of a permanent shift of activities.)

AI-chan returned the same day of Activ8's statement in [a livestream](https://youtu.be/x58aOzpWoGU) where she also explained her absence. (As many commenters point out, there are moments where it sounds like she's crying. *Was she forced by upd8 to cover up the real situation? Was she sad about fans' reactions to the new AIs? Was she dealing with a personal issue at the time? Was it even crying? Was it just weird laughter?* I don't know. I won't surmise anything from this.)

In the month after Summer Sonic, her uploads were still scarce (as stated in the previous section, some were from the June backlog).

## Return

From October 2019 on, she seemed to have actually returned to YouTube. Often appearing alongside Love-chan and AI-pii, nobody could reasonably argue that these new videos were months-old recordings. Although her appearances weren't as frequent as they were before (she used to upload almost daily to both channels), she was back.

This is where the replacement rumor should've ended.

But of course it didn't, which is partly why Love-chan and AI-pii felt the need to shed the identity of Kizuna AI and [leave her channel](https://youtu.be/AmLFSguxTRY).
The rumor will undoubtedly still persist, but at least it's easier to debunk now.
