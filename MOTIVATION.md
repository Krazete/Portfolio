# Motivation

This project was made mostly in response to the common misinformed claim that the original has been replaced or was being forced out by upd8.
This was never the case.

## Addressing Rumors

AI-chan said during AI Party 2019 that [she never planned on leaving](https://warosu.org/jp/thread/21612492#p21615639).
A month later, AI-pii [addressed the growing concerns in her livestream](https://youtu.be/IwIoDYymgVs?t=61) saying AI-chan wasn't leaving, and she'd bring her back if she did.

## Activities Beyond YouTube

During Love-chan's and AI-pii's existence as Kizuna AIs, AI-chan:

* released the song [Sky High](https://youtu.be/yLrstz80MKs) (which, as AI-pii mentioned in the previous link, does not insinuate AI-chan's departure), the cover song [Kizunami](https://youtu.be/vHeK-SDTMyU), and the album [Replies](https://youtu.be/Io_GOr3YAN0),
* [performed](https://i.imgur.com/nAEKjBZ.png) at [Summer Sonic](https://youtu.be/O57ueFS0M6o), [DIVE XR Festival](https://twitter.com/aichan_nel/status/1175769837622030337), [J-WAVE Innovation World Festa](https://twitter.com/aichan_nel/status/1173189719578042369), [Bilibili Macro Link Visual Release](https://twitter.com/aichan_nel/status/1152094751849504770), and
* cohosted the television program [てえてえTV](https://cu.ntv.co.jp/program/tetete2/) alongside fellow upd8 members the Omega Sisters

Meanwhile, her voice model Kasuga Nozomi took on some voice acting roles:

* Granbelm (as Mimi Rin)
* Infinite Dendrogram (as the interface AI)
* Shirobako Movie (as a virtual idol *(I haven't seen it; I'm just taking Discord user Guest#3616's word for it.)*)

In short, she wasn't replaced.
She was busy.

Hopefully this project helps to clarify the fact that AI-chan never left.
