# Motivation

This project was made mostly in response to the common misinformed claim that the original has been replaced or was being forced out by upd8.
This was never the case.

AI-chan said during A.I.Party! 2019 that [she never planned on leaving](https://warosu.org/jp/thread/21612492#p21615639).
A month later, AI-pii [addressed the growing concerns in her livestream](https://youtu.be/IwIoDYymgVs?t=61) saying AI-chan wasn't leaving, and she'd bring her back if she did.

During Love-chan and AI-pii's existence as Kizuna AIs, AI-chan was doing things outside of YouTube:

* released her original song [Sky High](https://youtu.be/yLrstz80MKs)
  * some people believed the lyrics insinuated AI-chan's departure; as AI-pii mentioned in [the previous link](https://youtu.be/IwIoDYymgVs?t=61), this is not true
* released a cover of [Kizunami](https://youtu.be/vHeK-SDTMyU)
* released her first EP [Replies](https://youtu.be/Io_GOr3YAN0)
* [performed](https://i.imgur.com/nAEKjBZ.png) at [Summer Sonic](https://youtu.be/O57ueFS0M6o)
* performed at [DIVE XR Festival](https://twitter.com/aichan_nel/status/1175769837622030337)
* performed at [J-WAVE Innovation World Festa](https://twitter.com/aichan_nel/status/1173189719578042369)
* performed at [Bilibili Macro Link Visual Release](https://twitter.com/aichan_nel/status/1152094751849504770)
* cohosted the television program [てえてえTV](https://cu.ntv.co.jp/program/tetete2/) alongside fellow upd8 members the Omega Sisters

Meanwhile, her voice model Kasuga Nozomi took on some voice acting roles:

* Granbelm (as Mimi Rin)
* Infinite Dendrogram (as the interface AI)
* Shirobako Movie (as a virtual idol [according to Discord user Guest#3616](https://discord.com/channels/306517676535185409/604887320201658399/683381006925168665))

In short, she wasn't replaced.
She was busy.

Hopefully this project helps to clarify the fact that AI-chan never left.
